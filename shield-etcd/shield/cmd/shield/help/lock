USAGE: @G{shield} lock

  Lock a SHIELD Core.

  SHIELD maintains an internal encrypted vault of secrets,
  for protecting your data archives with strong encryption.
  Locking the SHIELD core seals this vault, and prevents
  all backup and restore tasks from being scheduled until
  SHIELD is unlocked, using the SHIELD master password.
