USAGE: @G{shield} timespec @Y{"a timespec string"}

  Validate a scheduling timespec against a SHIELD Core

  When you schedule backup jobs in SHIELD, you use a language
  called "timespec" to indicate when and how often you want the
  job to execute.  This command parses a timespec (server-side)
  and re-assembles it into canonical form.
