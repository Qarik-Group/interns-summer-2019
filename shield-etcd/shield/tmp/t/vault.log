Vault v0.9.0 ('bdac1854478538052ba5b7ec9a9ec688d35a3335')
==> WARNING: mlock not supported on this system!

  An `mlockall(2)`-like syscall to prevent memory from being
  swapped to disk is not supported on this system. Running
  Vault on an mlockall(2) enabled system is much more secure.

==> Vault server configuration:
